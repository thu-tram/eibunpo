# Parenthetical Expressions

A parenthetical expression is a word or group of words added to a sentence without changing the meaning or grammar of the original sentence.

Some information in a sentence is essential to its meaning, and some details may be less important or "nonessential". The nonessentail portion is called the parenthetical expression:

This example has a complete thought with or without the parenthetical expression:

The police, hoping to save time, took the expressway.

**TAKE NOTE:** When writing a parenthetical expression, you have to use a pair of punctuation marks - one for the opening and one for the closing - unless it is at the beginning or the end of the sentence.

Here are some examples of parenthetical expressions:

Most beverages, sodas for example, are not good for us.

Fe, a doctor, has a new restaurant.
